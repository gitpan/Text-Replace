 Software Version Description

 for

 Text::Replace - Replace variables in templates

 Revision: B

 Version: 0.03

 Date: 2003/09/15

 Prepared for: General Public

 Classification: NONE

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The "L<Text::Replace|Text::Replace>" module, 
extends the Perl language (the system).

The US DOD 2167A software development standard creates and cites a
fully decent number of Data Item Descriptions (DID). 
A DID and US DOD 490A, Specification Practices, specify in
great detail the paragraph number, headings and the information
required for each paragraph in the document govern by the DID.

The usually approach is for suppliers of the DIDs to set up templates
and fill in the template with the missing information to complete the
DID document.

Different organizations use different degrees of automation. 
Some will have hard copy templates. Some will use word processor
templates. Others will use Visual Basic to merge database information
into a template. 

The methods in this module support a Perl automation of this processes
by merging a hash of variables with a template.

Replacement of variables in a template has many others uses beside
filling out technical document templates such as merging mailing list
with emails or form letters.

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This document releases Text::Replace version 0.03
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.

Use the new modules from the break-up of the "File::FileUtil" module

=item Text-Replace-0.01

Broke up the "Test::STD::STDutil" module and moved it to more
appropriate places in the high level directory tree.

=item Text-Replace-0.02

Change the test so that test support program modules resides in distribution
directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory. 
Because they are no longer in the lib directory, 
test support files will not be installed as a pre-condition for the 
test of this module.
The test of this module will precede immediately.
The test support files in the tlib directory will vanish after
the installtion.

=item Text-Replace-0.03

Recreate distribution file 
with Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode 777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get
emails from Unix installers about untar not being able to change to
a directory with mode of 666.

=head2 3.4 Adaptation data.

This installation requires that the installation site
has the Perl programming language installed.
There are no other additional requirements or tailoring needed of 
configurations files, adaptation data or other software needed for this
installation particular to any installation site.

=head2 3.5 Related documents.

=item Prerequistes.

 None.


=item Security, privacy, or safety precautions.

None.

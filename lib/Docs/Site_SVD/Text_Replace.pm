 Software Version Description

 for

 Text::Replace - Replace variables in templates

 Revision: D

 Version: 0.05

 Date: 2004/05/04

 Classification: NONE

=head1 1.0 SCOPE

This paragraph identifies and provides an overview
of the released files.

=head2 1.1 Identification

This release,
identified in L<3.2|/3.2 Inventory of software contents>,
is a collection of Perl modules that
extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

=head2 1.2 System overview

The C<Text::Replace> program module is simple and plain. 
This is intentional. The C<Text::Replace> mimics the
built-in Perl double quote, '"', literal scalar that
replaces Perl scalar variables named with a leading '$'.
The C<Text::Replace> program module foregoes 
expressiveness for convenience and performance.
Like a movie score, it stays in the background.
There is no large manual thicker than the Bible 
with tricks and tips and gyrations to learn and 
to distract.
It is amazing how many times, just a simple double quote
literal replacement in a small text string or even a
large text string gets the job done.

Does C<Text::Replace> solve all variable replacement, template
problems? Definitely not.
There is no capabilities for inserting graphs, text wrap plug-ins,
GD interface.
If an application needs something this sophisticated,
there are many fine template program modules in CPAN
such as the highly rated C<Template> program module.

=head2 1.3 Document overview.

This document releases Text::Replace version 0.05
providing a description of the inventory, installation
instructions and other information necessary to
utilize and track this release.

=head1 3.0 VERSION DESCRIPTION

All file specifications in this SVD
use the Unix operating
system file specification.

Broke away the template and table routines from Test::TestUtil
created this module Test::STD::STDutil.

=back

=item Test-STD-STDutil-0.02

Use the new modules from the break-up of the "File::FileUtil" module

=item Text-Replace-0.01

Broke up the "Test::STD::STDutil" module and moved it to more
appropriate places in the high level directory tree.

=item Text-Replace-0.02

Change the test so that test support program modules resides in distribution
directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory. 
Because they are no longer in the lib directory, 
test support files will not be installed as a pre-condition for the 
test of this module.
The test of this module will precede immediately.
The test support files in the tlib directory will vanish after
the installtion.

=item Text-Replace-0.03

Recreate distribution file 
with Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode 777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get
emails from Unix installers about untar not being able to change to
a directory with mode of 666.

=item Text-Column-0.04

Add the module 'Data::Secs2' in the tlib that provides 'stringify' support
for the 'Test::Tech' module.

=item Text-Column-0.05

The lastest build of C<Test::STDmaker> expects the test library in the same
directory as the test script.
Coordiated with the lastest Test::STDmaker by moving the
test library from tlib to t/Text, the same directory as the test script
and deleting the test library C<File::TestPath> program module,
adding the C<Data::SecsPack> and C<Data::Startup> to the test library.

Added Description, Subroutines, See Also headers. 
Clean up the Quality Assurance and Notes.

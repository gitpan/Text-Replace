=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Text::Replace> program module is simple and plain by design.
The C<Text::Replace> program module mimics the
built-in Perl double quote, '"', literal scalar that
replaces Perl scalar variables named with a leading '$'.
The C<Text::Replace> program module stays in the background,
just like John William's movie scores.
There is no large manual thicker than the Bible 
with tricks and tips and gyrations to learn and 
to distract. The module is plain, simple with
no expressiveness.
The C<Text::Replace> program module does only one
thing: substitute a value for a variable.
It is amazing how many times, just a simple double quote
literal replacement in a small string or even
a large text string gets the job done.

Does C<Text::Replace> solve all variable replacement, template
problems? Definitely not.
There is no capabilities for inserting graphs, text wrap plug-ins,
GD interface.
If an application needs something this sophisticated,
there are many fine template program modules in CPAN
such as the highly rated C<Template> program module.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=head2 replace_variables

The C<replace_variables> subroutine, takes a C<\$template> reference containing
Perl scalar variables, always named the leading I<funny character> '$', 
and recursively looks up the value for the scalar variables in the 
C<\%variable_hash> and replaces the value in the C<\$template>.
The C<replace_variables> subroutine only replaces those variables
in the C<\@variable> list.

=head1 QUALITY ASSURANCE

Running the test script C<Replace.t> verifies
the requirements for this module.
The C<tmake.pl> cover script for L<Test::STDmaker|Test::STDmaker>
automatically generated the
C<Replace.t> test script, C<Replace.d> demo script,
and C<t::Text::Replace> program module POD,
from the C<t::Text::Replace> program module contents.
The C<tmake.pl> cover script automatically ran the
C<Replace.d> demo script and inserted the results
into the 'DEMONSTRATION' section above.
The  C<t::Text::Replace> program module
is in the distribution file
F<Text-Replace-$VERSION.tar.gz>.

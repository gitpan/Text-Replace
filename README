1.0 SCOPE
    This paragraph identifies and provides an overview of the released
    files.

  1.1 Identification
    This release, identified in 3.2, is a collection of Perl modules that
    extend the capabilities of the Perl language.

  1.2 System overview
    The "Text::Replace" module, extends the Perl language (the system).

    The US DOD 2167A software development standard creates and cites a fully
    decent number of Data Item Descriptions (DID). A DID and US DOD 490A,
    Specification Practices, specify in great detail the paragraph number,
    headings and the information required for each paragraph in the document
    govern by the DID.

    The usually approach is for suppliers of the DIDs to set up templates
    and fill in the template with the missing information to complete the
    DID document.

    Different organizations use different degrees of automation. Some will
    have hard copy templates. Some will use word processor templates. Others
    will use Visual Basic to merge database information into a template.

    The methods in this module support a Perl automation of this processes
    by merging a hash of variables with a template.

    Replacement of variables in a template has many others uses beside
    filling out technical document templates such as merging mailing list
    with emails or form letters.

  1.3 Document overview.
    This document releases Text::Replace version 0.03 providing a
    description of the inventory, installation instructions and other
    information necessary to utilize and track this release.

  3.3 Changes
    Changes are as follows:

    Test-STD-STDutil-0.01

        Rename Module
            At 02:44 AM 6/14/2003 +0200, Max Maischein wrote: A second thing
            that I would like you to reconsider is the naming of
            "Test::TestUtil" respectively "Test::Tech" - neither of those is
            descriptive of what the routines actually do or what the module
            implements. I would recommend renaming them to something closer
            to your other modules, maybe "Test::SVDMaker::Util" and
            "Test::SVDMaker::Tech", as some routines do not seem to be
            specific to the Test::-suite but rather general
            (format_array_table). Some parts (the "scrub" routines) might
            even better live in another module namespace,
            "Test::Util::ScrubData" or something like that.

            Broke away the template and table routines from Test::TestUtil
            created this module Test::STD::STDutil.

    Test-STD-STDutil-0.02
        Use the new modules from the break-up of the "File::FileUtil" module

    Text-Replace-0.01
        Broke up the "Test::STD::STDutil" module and moved it to more
        appropriate places in the high level directory tree.

    Text-Replace-0.02
        Change the test so that test support program modules resides in
        distribution directory tlib directory instead of the lib directory.
        Because they are no longer in the lib directory, test support files
        will not be installed as a pre-condition for the test of this
        module. The test of this module will precede immediately. The test
        support files in the tlib directory will vanish after the
        installtion.

    Text-Replace-0.03
        Recreate distribution file with Archive::TarGzip 0.02 that uses mode
        777 for directories instead of 666. Started to get emails from Unix
        installers about untar not being able to change to a directory with
        mode of 666.

  3.4 Adaptation data.
    This installation requires that the installation site has the Perl
    programming language installed. There are no other additional
    requirements or tailoring needed of configurations files, adaptation
    data or other software needed for this installation particular to any
    installation site.

  3.5 Related documents.
    There are no related documents needed for the installation and test of
    this release.

  3.6 Installation instructions.
    Instructions for installation, installation tests and installation
    support are as follows:

  3.7 Possible problems and known errors
    There is still much work needed to ensure the quality of this module as
    follows:

    *   State the functional requirements for each method including not only
        the GO paths but also what to expect for the NOGO paths

    *   All the tests are GO path tests. Should add NOGO tests.

    *   Add the requirements addressed as *# R: * comment to the tests

    *   Write a program to build a matrix to trace test step to the
        requirements and vice versa by parsing the *# R: * comments.
        Automatically insert the matrix in the Test::TestUtil POD.

4.0 NOTES
    The following are useful acronyms:

    .d  extension for a Perl demo script file

    .pm extension for a Perl Library Module
